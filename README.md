## WiFi Signal Strength Mapping

### Goals 
- Using provided tablets work alone or in teams to map out the WiFi signal strength of one or more floors of RTVC or SCHN.

### Pre-Lab
-   Dr. Bowie's lecture on Wi-Fi signal strength mapping
-  [ECT Tech Nugget - N35.0 - Wi-Fi Signal Mapping](https://youtu.be/Z-_h9zJS2BA?si=SeS8q0nzJ9zkNWcV) 

### Resources
-   ECT Dept provided tablet

### Task 0 - Destruction of University Lab Machines
Please note that this work is done on university equipment so YOUR equipment doesn't get broken and become non-functional. Please don't TRY and break the lab machines... however, that is their purpose is to have students do weird things with them. 

TL;DR - Try not to break the lab machines, but don't worry too much if something goes off the rails. Get and instructor and we'll help fix it. (Learning Moment!)

### Task 1 - NetApp Project Setup

1. Using the provided tablet, unlock it with the code: 1000

2. Open the app called "NetApp" on the bottom tool bar.

3. Select "Create new heat map" option and "Add Existing photo of a map.." option.

4. This will show a listing of several thumbnails of floor plans. Unfortunately they are VERY hard to figure out which one is which. Using the expand icon on the thumbnail (outlined in red in the image below) you can see the full image. Use the back arrow  in the lower left corner to go back to the full listing of thumbnails. ![](./images/netapp-3-icon.png)

All of the floor plans have titles. Find the floor plan for the floor you are mapping and select it.

5. When prompted provide a name for the project. Adding the name of the floor you are mapping is a good idea.

### Task 2 - Setting Project Scale

6. NetApp will show the floor plan image select and require the use provide a scale for the floor plan. Orient yourself to the floor plan and find a location that you can use to measure a distance. Find that distance by using a tape measure (ask the instructor) or using a known distance (e.g. the width of a door is usually 3 feet / 36 inches).

7. Using the yellow ruler icon in the lower right corner, select the ruler icon and then select two points on the floor plan are the location and distance you measured/selected. This will provide NetApp the correct scale for the floor plan.
